Hello, This project is built to be used anywhere, as i am inexperienced when making .DEB packages i have uploaded the .py code which i coded in Visual Studio, i recomend you test the software on Visual Studio before seeing if you can install it yourself. Thank you for reading this and considering VXT+ MP3
If you have any questions feel free to contact me at the email "premathassharavan@gmail.com"
